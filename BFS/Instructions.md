# Here are the rules

1. Python3
2. Must specify input and output
3. Must have some kind of tests
4. Demo in front of the class on Sunday. Because no one does anything on Sundays
5. Bonus points if you can do it as pythonic as possible [Zen of Python](<https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/> "So zen")

[Solution if you are a smooth brain](<https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/breadth-first-search-or-bfs-for-a-graph/> "you were so close")
